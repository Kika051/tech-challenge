        It was a powerful Colchis (Kolkheti) kingdom, where the king was Aeëtes.
        The Argonauts arrived exactly there to take a Golden Fleece. Most of the
        territories mentioned in the legend are real and described correctly.
        Colchis was a very rich country. They owned a golden fleece. It was an
        Aries who had a golden wool and on this Fleece it was written how to get
        the gold through the sand of the river. The Kingdom of Colchis (Egrisi
        by Georgian sources) was a large kingdom of western Georgia. In ancient
        Greek mythology, Colchis is mentioned as the country of origin of Aeëtes
        and Medea. Medea was the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis, Georgia.
